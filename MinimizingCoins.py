"""
Main problem: Find the minimum number of coins that can sum up to x.
Sub problem: Find the mininum number of coins that can sum up to k+c1,k+c2, k+c3 ...... k+cn where k+ci < x
Base problem: For sum 0, we can say that minimum number of coins is 0
State: dp[k] Minimum number of coins that sum up to x.
Transition: For any k, minimum of (k + i) where i is the coins.
    
for eg: for n=3 x=11 and coins = [1 5 7]. Minimum number of coins will be 3 that will sum up to 11 (1, 5, 5)

1 -> 1 + 1 / 1 + 5 / 1 + 7

1 + 1 = 2 -> 2 + 1 / 2 + 5 / 2 + 7

1 + 5 = 6 -> 6 + 1 / 6 + 5(11) -> 1 + 5 + 5 Answer

1 + 7 = 8 -> 8 + 1

so on .....
